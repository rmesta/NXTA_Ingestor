# `nexcheck` is a framework for independent NEX check scripts, to be run against a Collector or group of Collectors
# TODO make it so we can check various attributes globally not just NEX checks, for finding patterns in collector data

# ----------------------- README ----------------------------
# *** nexchecklets requirements/design (under bin/nexchecklets) 
# We expect basic input to these scripts only!
#   $1 to the nexchecklet is the Collector path 
#   NEX-specific checks can check any of the following:
#       * presence of a patch
#       * behavior demonstrating the presence of the bug 
#   each script only checks one thing (patch or bug); supplemental scripts should be added if necessary (eg. patch + behavior)
#   if the script does not detect the bug or the patch, nothing is output. 
#   the script output should output its filename and what was checked as precisely as possible (eg. check for known conditions if possible but indicate if the 
#       issue may not be precisely detected (eg. NEX-4444.bug: (possible) mutant spiders)
#   scripts should be named after the NEX issue specifically, with a suffix, eg. "NEX-5555.bug" for readability.
#   scriptlets files need to be chmod +x
#   Do NOT make the scripts output anything if nothing is detected. 
#   Please include a Collector path in comments of the script where it tests successfully
#   Please test your script for proper functionality before inclusion: ./NEX-FOO.bug <path-to-collector>
#   See NEX-7551.bug for an example.


# TODO need to make this per-version (collector.conf) specific for NEX detection
# TODO allow for selection of 'hardware' type issues (eg. -t=hardware or -t=software) to search for all issues of a specific 'type' 
#    as would be detected in csummary
